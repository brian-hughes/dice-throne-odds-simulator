# Dice Throne Simulator

Static TypeScript app that simulates 5 custom dice for a chosen hero and runs 10000 trials to estimate ability activation probabilities.

Quick start:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
# open dist/index.html in your browser (file:// is fine)
```

Notes:
- Edit `src/heroes.ts` to define custom die faces and abilities per hero.
- Run `npm run build` to produce `dist/index.html` and `dist/bundle.js`.
